# Available machine learning model

These models, which are the fine-tuned model of H2O AI, performed the best score and were used as a pan-cancer analysis in the paper.

## How to used

The input data is structured as a matrix where:

  * Rows represent individual patient samples
  * Columns represent pathways and pathway links
  * Cell values contain log p-values

Then, the model will be predicted Alive or Dead as an output.
